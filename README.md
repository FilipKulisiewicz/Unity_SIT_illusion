# VR Magnification Illusion Study – Unity Project

This repository contains the Unity project for a Virtual Reality environment developed as part of a follow-up study on the **magnification illusion** in VR.  
The project was conducted during an exchange program at **Shibaura Institute of Technology**, within the **Applied Perception Engineering Laboratory**.

This VR setup was developed to support and extend findings from the study:
